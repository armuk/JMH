The JIRA Advanced Mail Handler is an extension of the standard JIRA email handler; 
it allows users to define many fields of the newly created issue (reporter, project key, type, 
priority, affected components, etc.) directly in the body of the email message. Hence, one of 
its notable features is that you do not need to repeat the whole process (opening a mail account 
on your mailserver, creating a mail account in JIRA, associate a handler service to the mail 
account and configure it) for each project you have in your JIRA installation; you just do the 
process once, setting a global mail account and handler service that will receive messages for all projects.
